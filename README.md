# 5-Day Generative AI Intensive

## Overview
The **5-Day Generative AI Intensive** is a structured online program running from **November 11 - 15**, designed to help participants gain a deep understanding of Generative AI technologies. Created by **Googleâ€™s ML researchers and engineers**, this program features conceptual deep dives and hands-on coding exercises to enable learners to confidently work on Generative AI projects.

## How It Works
Each day, participants will receive:
- **ðŸ“š Daily Assignments**
  - Newly published white papers
  - A companion podcast (generated by NotebookLM)
  - Companion code labs in AI Studio
- **ðŸ’¬ Discord Discussion Threads**
  - Dedicated Kaggle Discord channels for discussions, clarifications, and networking
- **ðŸŽ¥ Daily Livestream Seminars & AMAs**
  - Live sessions on Kaggleâ€™s YouTube channel featuring course authors, contributors, and guest speakers
  - Interactive Q&A and engaging learning activities
